# unity-2d-pachinko

A game I did as a submission to [this Unity Learn project](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-sprite-pachinko).

## Where to get the game?

A WebGL version of the game can be accessed [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/2d-pachinko-1-0), where the game will launch in the browser and be playable almost instantly.

For versions that run off your computer instead of the browser, check the [releases](https://github.com/Brandon-Gui123/unity-2d-pachinko/releases) page of this repository.
